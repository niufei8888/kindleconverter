swell,The front of her blouse plumped up in curves; her skirt swelled as her hips and thighs returned to the world.  He couldn't remember, and one look at his hands both swollen, the knuckles of the right scuffed and scabbed made him decide he didn't want to remember.
beam,'We are the True Knot and we endure,' they chanted in the crisscrossing beams of the RVs. 
silvery,The silvery stuff settled over her face and it was cold, cold.

dangle,On another was a cute kitten with startled eyes, dangling from a tree branch. 
throb,His head, which had begun to feel the teeniest bit better, started to throb again as his heartbeat picked up speed, and when he shoved his hand into the pocket, it brought up nothing but a ten-dollar bill and two toothpicks, one of which poked under his index fingernail and into the sensitive meat beneath.

nurse,On his third day the head nurse smelled booze on his breath and it was seeya, wouldn't want to beya. 
turnpike,A smell, fading and unpleasant, like the smell of burned rubber on a stretch of turnpike where there has been a bad accident not long before.

penance,He did it, he guessed, as a weird kind of penance. 
crappy,It occurred to him more than once that if he'd had Deenie's address, he would have sent her that crappy seventy bucks long ago.

swirl,Although the sun was now bright enough to twinkle the chrome of the few slant-parked cars in front of Olympia Sports and the Fresh Day Spa, the snow still swirled, making Dan think of something his mother had said during similar spring weather, long ago, when they had lived in Vermont: The devil's beating his wife. 
hospice,The hospice he'd passed on his amble up Cranmore Avenue would be the logical place to start, and he had an idea didn't know if it was the shining or just ordinary intuition that they'd be hiring, but he wasn't sure he wanted to go there just yet.

teeny,And there was the train, of course, the one with the teeny passenger cars and the big turbodiesel engine.
